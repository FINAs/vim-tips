# vim-tips

Here's the tip database. Really fancy, right?

To add your own, just add a block like this:

    ```author
    First, add your name after the first ``` block. Don't add special chars here, please.

    Then just type your tip here :)

    You may add new lines or anything really, just make sure the tip is cool!
